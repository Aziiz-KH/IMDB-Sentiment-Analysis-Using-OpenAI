2024-07-05 16:07:29,718 - INFO - Review: one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked. they are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.  the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word go. trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.  it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary. it focuses mainly on emerald city, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. em city is home to many..aryans, muslims, gangstas, latinos, christians, italians, irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.  i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...oz doesn't mess around. the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, i couldn't say i was ready for it, but as i watched more, i developed a taste for oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) watching oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.

2024-07-05 16:07:31,442 - INFO - Review: a wonderful little production.   the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece.   the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only "has got all the polari" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life.   the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.

2024-07-05 16:07:31,941 - INFO - Review: i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. the plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2: risk addiction, i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.  this was the most i'd laughed at one of woody's comedies in years (dare i say a decade?). while i've never been impressed with scarlet johanson, in this she managed to tone down her "sexy" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.  this may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than "devil wears prada" and more interesting than "superman" a great comedy to go see with friends.

2024-07-05 16:07:33,580 - INFO - Review: petter mattei's "love in the time of money" is a visually stunning film to watch. mr. mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter.   this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect. each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.  the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.  the acting is good under mr. mattei's direction. steve buscemi, rosario dawson, carol kane, michael imperioli, adrian grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.  we wish mr. mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.

(elijah wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????  >and the whole machine vs. humans theme was the matrix..or terminator.....  there are more examples but why waste the time? and will someone tell me what was with the nazi's?!?! nazi's????   there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. the movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either.   just awful. a real disappointment to say the least. save your money.

(according to my grading scale: 3/10 means pretty much both boring & bad. as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to 15.)

2024-07-05 16:07:59,901 - INFO - Review: "the cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. this is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. this is the best movie of the year to date.  i've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. this movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. "the cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don't want any more? personally, i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.  we've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, i do agree that the "genre" is a bit overworked. the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. but "the cell" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.  i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. "the cell" wants to let you "see" what it's all about and not "how" it's all about, and i guess that's what some people don't like. true, i do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.  i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. i wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. if it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.  i've noticed that i've kind of been repeating myself. not because there's nothing else to say, but because i can't stress enough how fantastic i thought "the cell" was. if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. i guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as "weird" or "crazy". i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. leaving the theater, i heard one audience member say "whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs." if so, i want what he was smoking.  **** (out of 4)

2024-07-05 16:08:04,555 - INFO - Review: 'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era "cold mountain," starring jude law, nicole kidman and rene zellweger is such a film.  then again, calling cold mountain" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts "glory" director edward zwick shame. however, "cold mountain" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.  "cold mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by rene zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.  within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern "lawman," and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by "the war of northern aggression," mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.  director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.  make no mistake, "cold mountain" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.

2024-07-05 16:08:05,627 - INFO - Review: taut and organically gripping, edward dmytryk's crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely "message" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.  bivouacked in washington, dc, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where robert ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (sam levene) to death because he happens to be jewish. police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum, who's assigned to ryan's outfit. suspicion falls on the second of the three (george cooper), who has vanished. ryan slays the third buddy (steve brodie) to insure his silence before young closes in.  abetted by a superior script by john paxton, dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs. ryan, naturally, does his prototypical angry white male (and to the hilt), while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); young may never have been better. gloria grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, paul kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.  the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to young's reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). at least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why ryan hates jews (and hillbillies and...).  curiously, crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (richard brooks' the brick foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. news of the holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of europe, so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).  but while the change from homophobia to anti-semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. the victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating ryan's murderous rage.

2024-07-05 16:08:06,976 - INFO - Review: "ardh satya" is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema. directed by the great director govind nihalani, this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success. even today, ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india.  the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s. unlike any police of other cities in india, mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether. govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment.  amongst various police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of anand velankar, a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family. his father is a harsh police constable. anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother. anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction. the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.this leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction. resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.  the spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. he is aware of the system of the metro, where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end. his compromise towards unethical practice is negative. finally he gets suspended.  the direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. at many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments.  the practical approach of script is a major punch. alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today. those aspects are dealt brilliantly.  finally, the films belongs to the one man show, om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.

2024-07-05 16:08:08,974 - INFO - Review: one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo's troubles.   this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing "ridiculous". the first half of the film may be described as "slow" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out).   never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell'amore or l'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one).   the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, le conseguenze dell'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita  bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell'amore, l'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world.

2024-07-05 16:08:18,630 - INFO - Review: i had heard good things about "states of grace" and came in with an open mind. i thought that "god's army" was okay, and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. the film began with some shaky acting, and i thought, "well, maybe it will get better." unfortunately, it never did. the picture starts out by introducing two elders -- mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.  dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries, dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience. the film in no way reflects reality. missions are nothing like what dutcher shows (having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact) and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.  the conclusion, which i'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy. next time, dutcher, try making a movie that someone can identify with.

2024-07-05 16:08:24,590 - INFO - Review: preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.  there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.  this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.  typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.  i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.  when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.  similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.  the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.

2024-07-05 16:08:27,016 - INFO - Review: return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kung-fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood, and the protagonist gordon liu, the counterpart to the western's clint eastwood. digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest, this is "presented in shaw scope", just like the good old days.  this film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.  act one sets up the premise. workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. they can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.  act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. however, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. after some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like mr miyagi's style in karate kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.  act three is where the fight fest begins. with cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad-nausem in hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to! return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday, so, if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?

2024-07-05 16:08:32,560 - INFO - Review: as someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. it requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and really believable acting (aka great acting).   such is not the case with 'love machine'. it starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. it's downhill from there.  director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon. but to be fair to eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a real doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.  the premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, i guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. the film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.

2024-07-05 16:08:34,291 - INFO - Review: the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. of course it's not going to be an oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.  the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. it's just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.  i'd give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you're bored, and nothing else.  4/10

2024-07-05 16:08:35,397 - INFO - Review: i laughed all the way through this rotten movie. it's so unbelievable. a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. what happens? the office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! hilarious! next thing you know the two women are going at it. yep, they're lesbians! nothing rings true in this "lifetime for women with nothing better to do" movie. clunky dialogue like "i don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn't take it" doesn't help. there's a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. a sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave. the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. sheesh! no cliche is left unturned.

2024-07-05 16:08:36,648 - INFO - Review: no spoilers!!  after hitchcock's successful first american film, rebecca based upon daphne dumarier's lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period - mistaken identity and espionage. as the u.s. settled into world war ii and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker (during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock's sensibilities.  this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old barry kane (robert cummings) who, while at work at a los angeles airplane factory, meets new employee frank frye (norman lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city. these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model patricia martin (priscilla lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! of course in the land of hitchcock, patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.  in good form for this outing, hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. it's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of hitchcock's more memorable finales. look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban' on public attractions). while saboteur may not be one of hitchcock's most well known films, it's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific hitchcock villains. remember to look for hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!

2024-07-05 16:08:37,843 - INFO - Review: i just watched the dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.  it's not a "big" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my god, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.  the dresser is the story of sir, an aging shakespearean actor (finney), and his dresser norman (courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii. these are two men, each dependent upon the other: sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear. and norman lives his life vicariously through sir; without sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.  this is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. employer is really the wrong term to use, though. for although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.  yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are finney, courtenay, and the marvelous script by ronald harwood. that is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably eileen atkins as the long-suffering stage manager madge. there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.  although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards: best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay, best picture, best director (peter yates), and best adapted screenplay.  i had remembered this as being a good movie, but i wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end. if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then i encourage you to see the dresser.

2024-07-05 16:08:38,486 - INFO - Review: what happened? what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. actually, it never really got going. there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. steve martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, kate and angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.

2024-07-05 16:08:48,144 - INFO - Review: this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. the writer obviously bought the playbook "how to write a space disaster movie" and followed it play by play. in particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.  max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. but, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. to learn that the film was nominated for a "special visual effects" emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.  i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects!  and the plot holes are too numerous to mention. but i will pick one out as an example. now, i'm no nasa expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.  the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell. he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.  i give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.

2024-07-05 16:08:49,551 - INFO - Review: caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason, while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield. ty webb is funny, being the only character from the original. most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (henry wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt, being played by randy quaid. every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (i don't go in for law suits or motions. i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. and then i'm comin' upstairs junior, and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a**! do we have an understanding?). offsetting his small role however, is dan acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for bill murray. his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. overall caddyshack ii is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.

2024-07-05 16:08:50,687 - INFO - Review: honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. if the film was a little grainy it might have added some "creepiness factor" to what was going on. i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others, are more shocking than in aftermath. all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. this is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. it's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some "gore" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. on the other hand - genesis - cerda's "sequel" to aftermath (now available as a "double feature" released by unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material. although i don't care for aftermath at all, genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...

2024-07-05 16:08:52,012 - INFO - Review: i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written. its not just about entertainment. there's tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across. and yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn't watch sepet and/or gubra for 76 times).  i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? its really ironic how the characters relate. like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra. and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future.   and i absolutely love the voice-overs. its crude yet awakeningly fresh. like, when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard, then there was suddenly mukhsin's voice saying 'bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..' (the scene when he climbed the tree).  it captured malaysian's attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. for example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn't sorted out.   all i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it.   it kept me glued to the screen, i couldn't even take my eyes off it. not even to make out in the cinema. ha ha.

2024-07-05 16:08:57,066 - INFO - Review: maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the dvd, which is with the director as he keeps saying "hi, kids" into the camera like a buffoon), but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator. turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. there's a problem- and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! and with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. entrails of a virgin has neither. it's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made- it's there just for horn-dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads.  in this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by "a murderer" as he's credited. first off, the director kazuo 'gaira' komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. it looks like it's from another movie. then once settled into the house, there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on to the rape and killings. first the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. then the murderer, who like d'amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.  now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. this is like saying, however, that the crotons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. an eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name i can't remember. even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! on top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'gaira' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves). but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) you just want it to be done with, for the 'i hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.

"51 birch street" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. bravo!!!!!!!!

2024-07-05 16:09:02,260 - INFO - Review: oh god, i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) i may have been young, but i wasn't stupid. anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. i've seen more impressive effects at disneyland, i've seen better performances at a school play, and i've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.  the story is set in northern australia. a handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. after they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.  i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is lake placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think, with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind.  the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. unless you really want to see it, avoid blood surf.

2024-07-05 16:09:03,738 - INFO - Review: "fate" leads walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. as the story unfolds in real life and fiction, sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.  the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. the screenplay was probably the worst part about it. it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. the second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.  joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. he has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. he switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. the actual book in the film that's titled "the number 23" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. when carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. at this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.  the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston. overall, the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. rating 3/10

2024-07-05 16:09:07,451 - INFO - Review: this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. i wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end. if you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading.  gilbert's character, ophelia, is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. brad johnson, also an excellent actor, is matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. he is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.  the two meet on the beach through her daughter, pip, and initially, ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.  the chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. i wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.  i wanted mindless entertainment, and i got it with this. in regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. "a secret affair" with janine turner is far superior (not a steele book), as are some of steele's earlier books turned into film.

"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated." "wheel out the cripple!" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.  a must-see. fo sho, yo!

2024-07-05 16:09:18,694 - INFO - Review: my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. i was never completely lost, but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.  if it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus' followers do or believe. the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.  bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons. not unwatchable but also not worth watching.

(i always compare this movies to - for example - some spielberg's works and again-and-again don't understand the huge difference in what i see.) i like ed wood's movies cause it's so inept it's very funny. but people!!! "the chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". it's extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable. there's no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood. it's extremely inept amateurish film. it's definitely the worst movie i had ever seen (and i had seen a lot of "worst movies" - believe me). i warned you !!! 1/10

2024-07-05 16:13:44,754 - INFO - Review: one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked. they are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word go. trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary. it focuses mainly on emerald city, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. em city is home to many..aryans, muslims, gangstas, latinos, christians, italians, irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...oz doesn't mess around. the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, i couldn't say i was ready for it, but as i watched more, i developed a taste for oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) watching oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.

2024-07-05 16:13:45,901 - INFO - Review: a wonderful little production. <br /><br />the filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />the actors are extremely well chosen- michael sheen not only "has got all the polari" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />the realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.

2024-07-05 16:13:59,228 - INFO - Review: so im not a big fan of boll's work but then again not many are. i enjoyed his movie postal (maybe im the only one). boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. <br /><br />people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not far cry... this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. these players go by the names of til schweiger, udo kier and ralf moeller.<br /><br />three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. so the tale goes like this, jack carver played by til schweiger (yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. people have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. <br /><br />however, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. we see the evil mad scientist dr. krieger played by udo kier, making genetically-mutated-soldiers or gms as they are called. performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of "spoiler" vancouver for some reason. thats right no palm trees here. instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. we haven't even gone far before i started to cry (mehehe) i cannot go on any more.. if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.<br /><br />there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. until the whole cromed/albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. the movie far cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen.

2024-07-05 16:14:14,257 - INFO - Review: "the cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. this is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. this is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />i've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. this movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. "the cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don't want any more? personally, i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />we've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, i do agree that the "genre" is a bit overworked. the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. but "the cell" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. "the cell" wants to let you "see" what it's all about and not "how" it's all about, and i guess that's what some people don't like. true, i do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. i wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. if it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />i've noticed that i've kind of been repeating myself. not because there's nothing else to say, but because i can't stress enough how fantastic i thought "the cell" was. if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. i guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as "weird" or "crazy". i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. leaving the theater, i heard one audience member say "whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs." if so, i want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)

2024-07-05 16:14:17,238 - INFO - Review: 'war movie' is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. the civil war-era "cold mountain," starring jude law, nicole kidman and rene zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />then again, calling cold mountain" a war movie is not entirely accurate. true enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts "glory" director edward zwick shame. however, "cold mountain" is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman, played by jude law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain, north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, ada monroe, played by nicole kidman. at first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />"cold mountain" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. meanwhile, back at the farm, ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. coming to ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails ruby thewes, played by rene zellweger, who helps ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada.<br /><br />within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn south unfolds. the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby's deadbeat father, ray winstone as an unrepentant southern "lawman," and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. all have been greatly affected and changed by "the war of northern aggression," mostly for the worse. the dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />make no mistake, "cold mountain" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.

2024-07-05 16:14:22,179 - INFO - Review: one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man titta di girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian-speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non-life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing "ridiculous". the first half of the film may be described as "slow" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out). <br /><br />never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell'amore or l'imbalsamatore. another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. not unlike the machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the al pacino film insomnia), le conseguenze dell'amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia (played by olivia magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary anna) and the memory of titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator knows that to a man like titta, accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences. a film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, le conseguenze dell'amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt during the second half of the 70s. the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino-like fare, more la vita  bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell'amore, l'imbalsamatore and others. your loss, world.

2024-07-05 16:14:26,577 - INFO - Review: ever watched a movie that lost the plot? well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />where to begin? the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. what do they do? slide down and run like the rest of us? no, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.<br /><br />it really is only a movie as they say..

2024-07-05 16:14:39,209 - INFO - Review: preston sturgis' the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case.<br /><br />there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry.<br /><br />typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />i'm not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.

2024-07-05 16:14:41,712 - INFO - Review: return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kung-fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood, and the protagonist gordon liu, the counterpart to the western's clint eastwood. digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest, this is "presented in shaw scope", just like the good old days.<br /><br />this film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.<br /><br />act one sets up the premise. workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. they can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.<br /><br />act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. however, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. after some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like mr miyagi's style in karate kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.<br /><br />act three is where the fight fest begins. with cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad-nausem in hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to! return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday, so, if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?

2024-07-05 16:14:47,638 - INFO - Review: as someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. it requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and really believable acting (aka great acting). <br /><br />such is not the case with 'love machine'. it starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. it's downhill from there.<br /><br />director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon. but to be fair to eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a real doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.<br /><br />the premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, i guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. the film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.

2024-07-05 16:15:03,457 - INFO - Review: this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. the writer obviously bought the playbook "how to write a space disaster movie" and followed it play by play. in particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.<br /><br />max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. but, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. to learn that the film was nominated for a "special visual effects" emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.<br /><br />i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects!<br /><br />and the plot holes are too numerous to mention. but i will pick one out as an example. now, i'm no nasa expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.<br /><br />the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell. he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.<br /><br />i give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.

(the scene when he climbed the tree).<br /><br />it captured malaysian's attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. for example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn't sorted out. <br /><br />all i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. <br /><br />it kept me glued to the screen, i couldn't even take my eyes off it. not even to make out in the cinema. ha ha.

2024-07-05 16:15:12,297 - INFO - Review: maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the dvd, which is with the director as he keeps saying "hi, kids" into the camera like a buffoon), but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator. turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. there's a problem- and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! and with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. entrails of a virgin has neither. it's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made- it's there just for horn-dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads.<br /><br />in this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by "a murderer" as he's credited. first off, the director kazuo 'gaira' komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. it looks like it's from another movie. then once settled into the house, there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on to the rape and killings. first the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. then the murderer, who like d'amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.<br /><br />now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. this is like saying, however, that the crotons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. an eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name i can't remember. even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! on top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'gaira' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves). but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) you just want it to be done with, for the 'i hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.

2024-07-05 16:15:14,843 - INFO - Review: this film took me by surprise. i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 7.8, rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! if anything, they underrated this little gem.<br /><br />filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother mina, and less than forthcoming dad, mike. i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (mike & mina's son doug) was going to take us. as a matter of fact, i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this!<br /><br />life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. "51 birch street" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. bravo!!!!!!!!

"a secret affair" with janine turner is far superior (not a steele book), as are some of steele's earlier books turned into film.

2024-07-05 16:15:27,457 - INFO - Review: hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. take superheroes for example, for each x-man and spiderman, there are daredevil, elektra, ghost rider and hulk. japanese horror remakes are even worst. it only took the ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of mr. gore verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. the ring 2, the eye, dark water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges.<br /><br />the first grudge wasn't entirely bad. it was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy men in black ii? was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? for the grudge 2, the critic goes the same way.<br /><br />tired scares, bad acting (except for amber tamblyn), and clichs all over the place. three stories take place, on different places and time. there is aubrey (tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister karen (sarah michelle gellar) to death; allison (arielle kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. glad to say (and i mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.<br /><br />the chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn't enter a house, others that dig too deep. meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic. hey, doesn't that seem just like another bad japanese remake, something called pulse? yeah, day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge... against hollywood bullshits.

2024-07-05 16:15:28,748 - INFO - Review: "down periscope" has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs. since then, we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now.<br /><br />it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.<br /><br />the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile, alabama in 2002. a group of cub scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board.<br /><br />it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood... which is rare company.<br /><br />thanks to kelsey grammar, lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment!

2024-07-05 16:15:31,018 - INFO - Review: deanna durbin, nan grey and barbara read are "three smart girls" in this universal film from 1936, which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences. it also stars ray milland, mischa auer, charles winninger, john king, binnie barnes and alice brady. it's a sweet story about three young women, now living in switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (winninger) is marrying again. not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to america, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. realizing that the intended, called "precious" (barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count. this is arranged by their father's accountant (king). the man he chooses is a full-time drunk (auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (milland). what a mess.<br /><br />this is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by auer, milland, barnes and brady. the young women are pretty and all do good work. the emphasis, of course, is on young durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. in fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. she sings a delightful "il bacio" in a police station.<br /><br />one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by charles winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. in fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.<br /><br />universal gives durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. ray milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.<br /><br />very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna.

2024-07-05 16:15:32,213 - INFO - Review: if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england. other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with alfred molina, joan plowright, polly walker, josie lawrence, jim broadbent, miranda richardson, and michael kitchens in the major roles. under the brush stroke direction of mike newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye. reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.

"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated." "wheel out the cripple!" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />a must-see. fo sho, yo!

2024-07-05 16:15:35,971 - INFO - Review: my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. i was never completely lost, but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />if it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus' followers do or believe. the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.<br /><br />bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons. not unwatchable but also not worth watching.

"the chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". it's extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable. there's no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood. it's extremely inept amateurish film. it's definitely the worst movie i had ever seen (and i had seen a lot of "worst movies" - believe me). i warned you !!! 1/10
